# gssearchengine

Project Title: Academic Search Engine Google Scholar ++
Proposed people: Daqing He (dah44@pitt.edu)

Background: Google Scholar does not have an official API. The Python code at https://github.com/ckreibich/scholar.py provides a set of simple API functions. Wrapping the Python codes into an implementation of an academic search engine so that the users can specify the queries as typing in Google Scholar textbox, but they can organize the returned results based on citation counts, based on grouping by journal articles, conference papers, or books. More ideas can also be added by the team.

Outcome: 
A prototype academic search engine.
